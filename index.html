                <p class="fragment">Amateur Radio has been around for well over a century</p>
                <p class="fragment">You need a license to transmit</p>
                <p class="fragment">A bar to entry but not impossible</p>
                <p class="fragment">No license needed to listen though..</p>
                <p class="fragment">Police scanners, air band radios etc all fine.</p>

                    License needed as spectrums are shared among users.

                    <h2>What is SDR?</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">SDR stands for Software Defined Radio</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Moves the "complicated" parts of radio from hardware to software.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">No more signal processing done on chip</p>
                    <p class="fragment">One radio can now handle widely different radio protocols</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        A lot of parts to radio, mixing, modulating etc.
                        Same thing happened to modems if anyone remembers the pain of WinModems on Linux.
                        Signal processing was moved to software and the hardware became really cheap.

            <section>
                <h2>RTL-SDR</h2>
                <p>A very cheap, software defined radio that uses a DVB-T TV tuner dongle based on the RTL2832U chipset.</p>
                <p>Around 2010 - 2012 a discovery was made when writing a Linux driver for the dongle.</p>
                <p>The RAW radio information (IQ data) was being sent to the host.</p>
                <p>Quickly became the Swiss army knife of Radio Hackers</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    For anyone interested in the full history, you can find it on http://rtlsdr.org.

                <h2>Why so popular?</h2>
                <p class="fragment">Costs roughly €20 dongle + basic antenna</p>
                <p class="fragment">Listen to any frequency between 24-1800Mhz</p>
                <p class="fragment">Will do AM/FM and any other modulation once you have the software</p>
                <p class="fragment">Spectrum no longer limited to Amateur Radio Circles</p>
                <p class="fragment">Did I mention the price?</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Radio Astronomy side of SDR is a community in itself. 
                    The Milky Way is seen to arch across the sky in a giant band. 
                    The galactic centre which emits strongly is to the bottom right of the picture. 
                    The local Cygnus - Orion spiral arm (in which we are located) is the red area in the top centre.

                <aside class="notes">
                    RTL-SDR can be used to listen to ADS-B signals from aircraft around 1090Mhz.

                <aside class="notes">
                    You can download images from NOAA weather satellites using an SDR tuned around 137Mhz.
                    You can also receive signals from dead satellites in orbit with the right dish and patience. 
                    Communication with ISS can also be heard as it passes by.

                <p class="fragment">Makers in the SDR world generally using Python/Matlab etc</p>
                <p class="fragment">Lack of equivalent modules like numpy, scipy on Node.js make it difficult.</p>
